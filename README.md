Basic webscrapping to get all recipes from minecraft, since we don't have any idea, to how to make it simplier.. we will keep this atm

# How it's working

We're getting all the images from a website : https://www.minecraftcrafting.info/

And that's all..

# Run the scrapper

> So.. If you don't have python & pip & ... hf, I don't know your distro

let's enter in the venv :
```python
source venv/bin/activate
```

now we can run the project..
```python
python src/scraper.py
```

Et voila :^)
